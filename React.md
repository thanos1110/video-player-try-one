## what is hooks
  Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.
  Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

## JavaScript Hoisting
  Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
